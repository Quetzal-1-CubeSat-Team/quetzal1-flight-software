## Directory Description

This repository serves as the central location for the flight software for Quetzal-1. We are indebted to the open-source community, as a large part of the hardware and software was inspired and based on open-source platforms, such as [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), and libraries written by its ever-expanding community.

The software for the following subsystems is included in this repository:

1. `ADCS/`: contains the software for the Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS).
2. `EPS/`: contains the software for the Electrical Power System (EPS).

Lastly, the `media/` directory contains miscellaneous photos relating to the satellite in general, that may be of use and serve as reference to the user.
